The following instructions are for Linux operating system and Windows is currently not supported. All command lines start with a "$" symbol, which indicates Bash shell command-line prompt: these "$" symbols should be omitted when entering commands into your shell.

I. INSTALLATION
The following software o be present in the system before attempting to use .



Brief training and predicting process:
1. Download all files to your folder.

2. Download Data.tar.gz (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lDfHnsby79DQoabxNGfQbZFCc8SwTwJy/view?usp=share_link) and put them into CombDrugModule folder, uncompress it.

3. `python 1-get_train_model.py`: Get training model. It needs around 150G space to store training model.

4. `python 2-get_predict_result.py example_input.csv example_output.csv`: Get predict result.


The detail of installation package and process will publish soon.
